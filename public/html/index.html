                  <p>Our family, like most I suppose, has its share of rascals and rogues, and like most families, our black sheep eventually reformed. More or less. After ten years of foreign adventures, one of our founders came home. He took the old family traditons of Clan MacKay from his paternal grandmother and the wild spirit of Russia from his paternal grandfather. He also took the lore and legacy of the cannymoonshiner in the Smoky Mountains handed down from his maternal grandfather to establish Florida's finest artisanal distillery near Dunnellon, Florida. Fish Hawk's spirits are made from Florida grown and produced products.
