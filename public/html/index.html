                  <p>Our family, like most I suppose, has its share of rascals and rogues, and like most families, our black sheep eventually reformed. More or less. After ten years of foreign adventures, one of our founders came home. He took the old family traditons of Clan MacKay from his paternal grandmother and the wild spirit of Russia from his paternal grandfather. He also took the lore and legacy of the cannymoonshiner in the Smoky Mountains handed down from his maternal grandfather to establish Florida's finest artisanal distillery near Dunnellon, Florida. Fish Hawk's spirits are made from Florida grown and produced products.

                  <p>At Fish Hawk Spirits we have captured the essence of Florida’s sunshine tree in our smooth, aromatic Marion Black 106. This 106 proof spirit is named for Marion County (where it is produced), and seasoned with Blackberries and toasted American White Oak.
This easy sipping, Tangerine Brandy, is a connoisseur’s pleasure.

Served over crushed ice with a splash of water or soda to open the flavors, yeild pleasant fruit and citrus notes on the palate with a long smooth finish.

Every drop in every bottle we produce was first a blossom on a tree in an orange grove. It takes more than 60 tangerines to make each bottle of our smooth aromatic Marion Black 106.
