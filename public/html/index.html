          <h3>Absynth</h3>
          <p>Our family, like most I suppose, has its share of rascals and rogues, and like most families, our black sheep eventually reformed. More or less. After ten years of foreign adventures, one of our founders came home. He took the old family traditons of Clan MacKay from his paternal grandmother and the wild spirit of Russia from his paternal grandfather. He also took the lore and legacy of the cannymoonshiner in the Smoky Mountains handed down from his maternal grandfather to establish Florida's finest artisanal distillery near Dunnellon, Florida. Fish Hawk's spirits are made from Florida grown and produced products.</p>

          <p>At Fish Hawk Spirits we have captured the essence of Florida’s sunshine tree in our smooth, aromatic Marion Black 106. This 106 proof spirit is named for Marion County (where it is produced), and seasoned with Blackberries and toasted American White Oak.
            This easy sipping, Tangerine Brandy, is a connoisseur’s pleasure.Served over crushed ice with a splash of water or soda to open the flavors, yeild pleasant fruit and citrus notes on the palate with a long smooth finish.
            Every drop in every bottle we produce was first a blossom on a tree in an orange grove. It takes more than 60 tangerines to make each bottle of our smooth aromatic Marion Black 106.</p>

          <h3>Marion</h3>
          <p>From Bimini to Bermuda and from St. Maarten to Stockhold, we've shared a lot of good times. Inside this bottle is the result of a lot more work than we usually like to do, and it was well worth it. We take making our run seriously. We hope you have as much fun drinking it as we do making it.</p>

          <h3>Vodka</h3>
          <p>After the last frost has come and gone, the fields in North Central Florida begin to awake. April brings warm temperatures and little green berries begin to plump and turn. After only a few days in the warm sun-soaked daylight, the Florida Blueberry crop begins to ripen to a delcious deep blue. These blue gems are a Florida treasure and are hand-crafted & distilled only miles from where they are harvested. Imagine enjoying this smooth spirit from a back porch, rocking chair creeking, and your best dog laying at your feet, just as we do at the farm.</p>
